## v0.1.0

Initial Release.

`nerves_hub_ca` is released as a docker image and pushed to dockerhub.
The `ENTRYPOINT` of the container is configured to execute an included
`docker-entrypoint.sh` script which will perform an `aws s3 sync` of the
production certificates. 

If you are using this image privately, you can either
specify your own bucket / aws credentials when running the container:

```
docker run --rm --name nerves-hub-ca \
  -e "S3_BUCKET=my-bucket" \
  -e "AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1" \
  -e "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=12345" \
  -e "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=67890" \
  -p 8443:8443 \
  nerveshub/nerves_hub_ca:0.1.0
```

Or you can override the `ENTRYPOINT` by basing a new image off 
`nerveshub/nerves_hub_ca:0.1.0`

```
FROM nerveshub/nerves_hub_ca:0.1.0

ENTRYPOINT "my-entrypoint.sh"
```
